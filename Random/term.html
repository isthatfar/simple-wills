<p class="categ">Introduction</p>

<p>If you buy Documents and/or Services from us you agree to be legally bound by these terms and conditions which form part of the contract between us and you.</p>

<p>You may only buy Documents and/or Services from us for non-business reasons.</p>

<p>The Documents and/or Services you purchase are for your personal use only and cannot be bought for any third party or for resale. If you buy a Document and/or Service for a third party or resell it, we shall not be liable for that Document and/or Service or any subsequent or related loss. You represent and warrant that any Document and/or Service ordered and purchased by you is not for resale and that you are acting as principal and not as agent. We shall not be liable for any Document and/or Service to any third party.</p>

<p>When buying any Document and/or Service you also agree to be legally bound by:</p>

<ol class="a">
	<li>any extra terms which may add to, remove and/or replace some of these terms and conditions. This may happen for security, legal or regulatory reasons. We will contact you to let you know if we intend to do this by giving you one months’ notice or, if that is not possible for any reason, we will contact you as soon as reasonably practicable; and</li>
	<li>any specific terms which apply to certain Documents and/or Services. If you want to see these specific terms, please speak with our customer service team who will tell you when specific terms apply.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of the above terms and conditions form part of the contract between us and you as though set out in full here.</p>

<p>We may change our terms and conditions, Documents and/or Services, or stop providing our Documents and/or Services, to reflect changes in law or regulation, or to make minor adjustments or improvements. If we do, we’ll let you know using the contact information you give us if we are required by law to do so. If you spot something that does not look right, please let us know.</p>

<p class="categ">Information we give you</p>

<p>By law, the <i>Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013</i> say that we must give you certain key information before a legally binding contract between you and us is made (see the summary box below). We will give you this information in a clear and understandable way. Typically, this information is provided to you before you buy the Documents and/or Services from us. Some of this information is also set out in this contract, such as information on our complaint handling policy.</p>

<p>We will give you information on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the main characteristics of the Documents and/or Services you want to buy</li>
	<li>who we are, where we are based and how you can contact us</li>
	<li>the total price of the Documents and/or Services including any taxes (or where this cannot reasonably be worked out in advance, the manner in which we will work out the price)</li>
	<li>the arrangements for payment, carrying out the Documents and/or Services and the time by which we will carry out the Documents and/or Services</li>
	<li>how to exercise your right to cancel the contract and the costs of doing so</li>
	<li>our complaint handling policy</li>
</ul>

<p>The key information we give you by law forms part of these terms and conditions (as though it is set out in full here).</p>

<p>If we have to change any key information once a legally binding contract between you and us is made, we can only do this if you agree to it.</p>

<p>All Documents and Services are provided in the English language.</p>

<p class="categ">Your privacy and personal information</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy is available at on our website at https://www.properwills.com/uk/privacy.html</p>

<p>Your privacy and personal information are important to us. Any personal information that you provide to us will be dealt with in line with our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from you, how and why we collect, store, use and share such information, your rights in relation to your personal information and how to contact us and supervisory authorities if you have a query or complaint about the use of your personal information.</p>

<p class="categ">Ordering Documents and/or Services from us</p>

<p>To purchase a Document and/or Service from us you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>agree to be bound by these terms and conditions and our Privacy Policy;</li>
<li>read the various pages on our Website and check that the Documents and/or Services we offer are suitable for you and your situation before you make an order from our Website;</li>
<li>be 18 years of age or over;</li>
<li>be able to read the Document we send you without assistance (if you do need assistance please let us know and we will endeavor to make our Documents and/or Services accessible to you);</li>
<li>require a Document, capable for use as a will in either England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland;</li>
<li>agree to take particular care when providing us with your details;</li>
<li>represent and warrant that all details and information you provide to us are accurate, complete, and are not false, misleading or misrepresent your intentions or identity in anyway (will not not independently verify or check the details you provide us, unless required by law); and</li>
<li>be a permanent resident in the United Kingdom (or, if you are not a permanent resident in the United Kingdom you may purchase a Document and/or Service on the understanding that we are not providing any advice and/or analysis (in respect of, including but not limited to, legal, tax or inheritance tax) on your particular situation and circumstances and that the Document(s) and/or Service(s) may not be suitable for your individual needs and that you shall not hold us liable for any loss incurred as a result of using such Document and/or Service).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Documents and Services will not be suitable if (i) your permanent home is not in the United Kingdom, and/or (ii) you own a business, agricultural property or other assets outside of the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>Our Documents and Services are not intended to be used (i) in a jurisdiction other than the one it was intended for (being either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (as applicable)), and/or (ii) if you have complicated circumstances, and/or (iii) if you require specialised tax advice (including in relation to inheritance tax). </p>

<p>The alterations which you can make to the Documents using our Services will be limited to predefined fields such as: your name, names of beneficiaries, names of executors and a description of assets. You will not be able to and will not be permitted to change or alter the main text on the Documents.</p>

<p>Below, we set out how a legally binding contract between you and us is made.</p>

<p>Any quotation given by us before you make an order for any Document and/or Service is not a binding offer by us to supply such Document and/or Service.</p>

<p>When you decide to place an order for a Document and/or Service with us, this is when you offer to buy such Document and/or Service from us.</p>

<p>When you place your order through our Website, we will acknowledge it by email. This acknowledgement does not, however, mean that your order has been accepted. Paying for your Document and/or Service will mean that you accept and agree to be bound by these terms, conditions and our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may contact you to say that we do not accept your order. If we do this, we will try to tell you promptly why we do not accept your order. This is typically for the following reasons:</p>

<ol class="a">
	<li>we cannot carry out the order (this may be because, for example, we have a shortage of staff);</li>
	<li>we cannot authorise your payment;</li>
	<li>you are not allowed to buy the Document and/or Service from us;</li>
	<li>we are not allowed to sell the Document and/or Service to you; or</li>
	<li>there has been a mistake on the pricing or description of the Document and/or Service.</li>
</ol>

<p>We will only accept your order when we confirm this to you by email (the “Confirmation Email”). At this point:</p>

<ol class="a">
	<li>a legally binding contract will be in place between you and us; and</li>
	<li>we will start to carry out the order in the way you and we have agreed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless we both agree otherwise, our contract will terminate automatically once we have provided the Document and/or Service to you.</p>

<p class="categ">Carrying out of the order</p>

<p>We must carry out the order by the time or within the period which you and we agree. If you and we have agreed no time or period, this will be within a reasonable time from the Confirmation Email.</p>

<p>Our carrying out of the order might be affected by events beyond our reasonable control. If so, there might be a delay before we can restart the order, having made reasonable efforts to limit the effect of any of those events and having kept you informed of the circumstances, but we will try to restart the order as soon as those events have been fixed. Examples of events which might be beyond our reasonable control include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there has been a change in any relevant law, rule or regulation;</li>
	<li>you change the order (and this means we have to do extra work or wait for extra information);</li>
	<li>we have to wait for other providers to complete their work before we are able to carry out the order;</li>
	<li>we experience technical problems; or</li>
	<li>we have to wait for you to provide additional information or confirmation of information we reasonably request.</li>
</ul>

<p class="categ">Providing the Documents and Services</p>

<p>We will make the Documents available either (i) to download (as digital content) as soon as we accept and have completed your order or (ii) where you requested a printed copy of the Document(s), we will provide you with an estimated date of delivery at the time of ordering. </p>

<p>Where we offer a delivery service for Documents and you have elected to have the documents printed and posted to you, the delivery period and cost of delivery will be as displayed to you on the Website. Documents will be sent to the address nominated by you at the time of ordering and cannot be altered.</p>

<p>If our supply of the Documents is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as reasonably possible to let you know and we will take reasonable steps to minimise the effect of the delay. We will not be liable for any loss caused by any delay, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any Document(s) you have paid us for but have not received. </p>

<p class="categ">Charges and payment</p>

<p>We will let you know the basis of calculating the charges for the Documents and/or Services and any related goods (and any extra charges such as delivery charges) to the fullest extent we can when you place an order with us.</p>

<p>We charge for the Documents and/or Services on a quotation basis (i.e. we promise to carry out the order at a fixed price).</p>

<p>We only accept electronic methods of payment, credit cards and debit cards. We do not accept cheques or cash.</p>

<p>You will be invoiced and your credit card or debit card will be charged when you have placed your order.</p>

<p>All payments by credit card or debit card need to be authorised by the relevant card issuer.</p>

<p>If your payment is not received by us, we may charge interest on any balance outstanding at the rate of 4 percentage points per year above the Bank of England’s base rate. We will email you to let you know if we intend to do this.</p>

<p>The price of the services is in pounds sterling (£)(GBP) and includes VAT (if applicable) at the applicable rate.</p>

<p>In the event that you decide not to sign a Document the price of the Document will not be refunded.</p>

<p class="categ">Right to cancel</p>

<p>Due to the bespoke nature of the Documents, you are not entitled to cancel your order or to return the Documents. However, you may return the Documents if either (i) the PDF file we provide you cannot be opened or is corrupted when you try to download the Document; or (ii) any printed version of the Document ordered is damaged upon receipt. The right to cancel the contract under the <i>Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013</i> does not apply to Documents purchased from us.</p>

<p>In the event that you order a printed version of the Document which is damaged upon receipt, we will bear the costs of the return.</p>

<p>All replacements for faulty or damaged Documents will be undertaken within 14 calendar days of receipt of the returned documents or the date you notify us that the Documents cannot be opened or are corrupted.</p>

<p>You can make changes to Documents for free for 5 years following our acceptance of your order for the Documents. This 5 year period does not form part of the Document or Service purchase price you pay but is a discretionary complimentary service provided by us and which may, in our sole and absolute discretion, be amended, reduced, extended or withdrawn without notice to you.</p>

<p class="categ">Nature of the Documents and Services</p>

<p>The <i>Consumer Rights Act 2015</i> gives you certain legal rights (also known as ‘statutory rights’), for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the Documents and/or Services are carried out with reasonable care and skill;</li>
	<li>you must pay a reasonable price for the Documents and/or Services, and no more if you and we haven’t fixed a price for the Documents and/or Services; and</li>
	<li>we must carry out the Documents and/or Services within a reasonable time if you and we haven’t fixed a time for the services to be carried out.</li>
</ul>

<p class="categ">Faulty services</p>

	<li>visit the Citizens Advice website www.citizensadvice.org.uk or call 03454 04 05 06.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nothing in this contract affects your legal rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (also known as ‘statutory rights’). You may also have other rights in law.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you want:</p>

<ol class="a">
	<li>us to repeat the services;</li>
	<li>us to fix the services; or</li>
	<li>a price reduction.</li>
</ol>

<p class="categ">End of the contract</p>

<p>If this contract is ended it will not affect our right to receive any money which you owe to us under this contract.</p>

<p class="categ">Disclaimer and limitation of liability</p>

<p>Properwills is not a law firm and is not registered or regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Law Society of Northern Ireland or Law Society of Scotland. </p>

<p>Any use of our Documents, Services or the Website by you does not create or constitute a lawyer-client relationship between Properwills (or any employee of or other person associated with Properwills) and you. It is solely and entirely your responsibility to satisfy yourself that the Documents you order and the nature of the Services that we offer meet with your requirements and are satisfactory and suitable for your needs and any legal or tax requirements. We cannot accept any responsibility to you if the Documents and/or Services you purchase from us are not legally correct or suitable for your situation.</p>

<p>When preparing Documents we have no responsibility and will accept no liability for checking or verifying:</p>

<ol>
	<li>your identity;</li>
	<li>your testamentary and/or mental capacity;</li>
	<li>whether you are or were subject to any undue influence when ordering your Document or using our Services;</li>
	<li>whether you are or were subject to any undue influence when signing your Document;</li>
	<li>whether your Document was signed correctly or signed in accordance with our guidance notes;</li>
	<li>whether you knew, understood and approved the contents of your Documents; and/or</li>
	<li>whether there are or were or might be any actual or potential third party beneficiary(ies) who might have a claim against your estate or challenge the validity of your Document.</li>
</ol>

<p>We provide you with guidance notes in order to assist you with the signing and execution of your Document in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it has been prepared for use (being either England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland). It is solely and entirely your responsibility to follow such notes and to ensure that the Document is validly signed and executed by you and any witness(es) and we shall have no liability if you fail to properly sign, witness or execute your Document. A failure to properly sign, witness or execute your Document will result in an invalid and unenforceable Document. We shall have no liability to you or any third party for the guidance notes, the execution and/or for the enforceability of any Document.</p>

<p>Your Document may become out-of-date or obsolete as a result of changes to any applicable law, rule, legislation, regulation or guidance and we do not and cannot guarantee that the  Document you order and sign will remain valid, up-to-date, complete or accurate. We have no ongoing obligation or any responsibility to notify you of any change in any law, rule, legislation, regulation or guidance or any potential impact such changes may have on your Document and we shall have no liability to you or any third party in respect of this. The responsibility for future reviews of the terms of your Document rests solely and entirely with you.</p>

<p>We do not review the data you provide us to create or generate a Document. We do not review or check for legal accuracy, correctness, suitability or completeness. We do not and cannot accept responsibility for the appropriateness or suitability of the Document to your specific circumstances or particular situation.</p>

<p>The Documents and Services are suitable for use only in specific jurisdictions: England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland. You should make sure you select the appropriate jurisdiction for you. If you live, are domiciled, or have assets or liabilities outside of the jurisdiction our Documents and Services are suitable for (being either England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland) then you should exercise caution when using any Document and/or Service as it may not be suitable and we shall have no liability for the appropriateness, suitability, validity or enforceability of the Document and/or Services in such circumstances.</p>

<p>We accept no liability whatsoever and offer no warranty whatsoever for any Document which is (or was) made available to you free of charge (whether by digital download or by post).</p>

<p>We accept no liability whatsoever and offer no warranty whatsoever for any Document originally purchased by you but subsequently updated by you free of charge (any such updated Document becomes a new Document). For the avoidance of doubt, any free update service we offer, provide or make available to you does not form part of the Document or Service purchase price you pay but is a discretionary complimentary service provided by us and which may, in our sole and absolute discretion, be amended, reduced, extended or withdrawn without notice to you.</p>

<p>We disclaim any and all liability to you for the supply of the Documents and our Services to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. This does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer. If we are found liable for any loss or damage to you such liability is limited to the amount you have paid for the relevant Document and/or Service.</p>

<p>In no event shall we be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, loss of data or any indirect, special, or consequential loss or any other loss which was not caused by any breach on our part.</p>

<p>The limitation of liability does not apply to personal injury or death arising as a direct result of our negligence or any other liability which we cannot exclude or limit under applicable law.</p>

<p>Our Documents and Services are exclusively for domestic and private use. If you use the Documents and/or Services for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>

<p class="categ">Disputes</p>

<p>If you are unhappy with:</p>

	<li>our service to you generally; or</li>
